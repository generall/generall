### Hi, it's Andrey

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer.
I prefer practical over theoretical, working demo over arXiv paper.

Currently working on a Vector Similarity Search Engine [Qdrant](https://github.com/qdrant/qdrant), which can be used for semantic search, simularity matching of text, images or even videos, and recommendations.

My CV is [here](https://blog.vasnetsov.com/andrey_vasnetsov_cv.pdf).
I also have a [blog](https://blog.vasnetsov.com) and a [telegram channel](https://t.me/neural_network_engineering)
